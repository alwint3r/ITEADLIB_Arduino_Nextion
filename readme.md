# Nextion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction

Nextion Arduino library provides an easy-to-use way to manipulate Nextion serial
displays. Users can use the libarry freely, either in commerical projects or
open-source prjects,  without any additional condiitons.

For more information about the Nextion display project, please visit
[the wikiã€‚](http://wiki.iteadstudio.com/Nextion_HMI_Solution)
The wiki provdies all the necessary technical documnets, quick start guide,
tutorials, demos, as well as some useful resources.

# Documentation

Offline Documentation's entry `doc/Documentation/index.html` shiped with source code
can be open in your browser such as Chrome, Firefox or any one you like.

# Suppported Mainboards

**All boards, which has one or more hardware serial, can be supported.**

For example:

  - Iteaduino MEGA2560
  - Iteaduino UNO
  - Arduino MEGA2560
  - Arduino UNO
  - Nano32 (Theoretically, all ESP32-based boards should be supported)

# Configuration

Most of Nextion hardware communicates with serial using 9600 as baudrate. So, you have to initialize the serial object with that baudrate.

# UNO-like Mainboards

If your board has only one hardware serial, such as UNO, you should disable
dbSerial and redirect nexSerial to Serial(Refer to section:`Serial configuration`).

# Example Usage

```arduino
#include "Arduino.h"
#include "HardwareSerial.h"
#include "Nextion.h"

HardwareSerial nextionSerial(1);
NexHardware nextion(&nextionSerial, &Serial);
NexButton btn(&nextion, 0, 1, "b0");
NexTouch* nex_listen_list[] = {
  &btn,
  NULL,
};

void btn0PopCallback(void *ptr) {
  Serial.println("Button 0 is touched");
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  nextionSerial.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1);

  if (!nextion.nexInit()) {
    Serial.println("Failed to initialize Nextion Hardware");
  }

  btn.attachPop(btn0PopCallback, &btn);
}

void loop() {
  nextion.nexLoop(nex_listen_list);
}

```
